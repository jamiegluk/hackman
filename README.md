## About

This is an old project.

- Created in 2012
- Using Dev Pascal (with Freepascal compiler)
- In High School
- As a Scottish Advanced Higher Computing final project.

We had to create some command line based game. The teacher expected a very basic game like Hangman. She said:

> You won't manage to create anything as advanced as Pac-Man

So I did.
